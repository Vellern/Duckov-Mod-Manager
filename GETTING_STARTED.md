## Tips and Tricks

### Speed Up Translations

- **Batch translate**: Translating multiple mods at once is faster than one-by-one
- **Cached translations**: The app remembers translations, so re-translating is instant
- **Filter first**: Filter mods before translating to focus on what you need

### Keep Your Mod List Up to Date

- Click "Scan Mods" after:
  - Subscribing to new mods
  - Unsubscribing from mods
  - Updating mods in Steam

### Search Power Tips

- **Partial matches**: Type "weap" to find "weapon" mods
- **Case insensitive**: Searching "RIFLE" finds "rifle", "Rifle", etc.
- **Search translated text**: If you've translated mods, search works on translated titles too

### Save Disk Space

Translation models take 500 MB - 1 GB. If you're short on space:
- Use an external drive for the app
- Or ensure you have 2+ GB free before installing

### Performance

- **First translation**: Slow (model download + first-time initialization)
- **Subsequent translations**: Fast (2-5 seconds per mod)
- **Cached translations**: Instant (already done before)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Planned for Future Release** - Currently all operations are mouse-driven
